This is a placeholder for the actual MobileNetV3 model weights. In a real implementation, this would be a binary file containing the trained model weights for dermatological condition detection. The file would be approximately 15-20MB in size and contain the pre-trained weights for melanoma, acne, and skin injury classification.
